# Location-based-social-network
community mining and recommendation system based on location, user interest and spatial-temporal trajectory

Location-based social network (LBSN) keeps a large number of spatial-temporal behavior track data of users. In our project, we choose to use foursquare Tokyo
check-in dataset and make community discovery and division. Then we visualize the temporal and spatial trajectories of places of interest and make a deeper interpretation
from the social perspective based on the analysis results. Also, we build a recommendation system and make an User Interface.
